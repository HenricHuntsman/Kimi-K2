```python
# The AI generates upscaling code like this:

class PokemonAIUpscaler:
    """AI-powered upscaler that transforms classic Pokémon games"""
    
    def upscale_pokemon_sprite(self, original_sprite):
        """
        Takes 8-bit Pokémon sprite, outputs Legends Arceus quality
        
        - Analyzes original design
        - Applies neural upscaling
        - Adds modern lighting and shading
        - Generates smooth animations
        - Maintains iconic look
        """
        enhanced = self.neural_upscale(original_sprite, target_res="4K")
        enhanced = self.apply_modern_shading(enhanced, style="legends_arceus")
        enhanced = self.add_particle_effects(enhanced)
        return enhanced
    
    def enhance_game_world(self, scene):
        """
        Transforms pixelated environments into beautiful landscapes
        
        - Route 1 becomes a stunning meadow
        - Viridian Forest gets realistic trees
        - Mt. Moon has atmospheric lighting
        - Cities look like Sword/Shield quality
        """
        return self.ai_environment_upgrade(scene, quality="switch")
```

**Before & After:**

```
BEFORE (Original Game Boy):
- 160x144 resolution
- 4-color palette
- Static sprites
- Pixelated graphics

AFTER (AI Enhanced):
- 1080p or 4K resolution
- Full color with modern effects
- Smooth animations
- Switch-quality graphics

- Nothing left behind!
```

**Example Transformations:**

```
Pikachu:
- From: 16x16 pixel yellow blob
- To: Fully detailed 3D-quality sprite with fur texture, 
      expressive animations, particle effects on attacks

Charizard:
- From: Basic orange dragon sprite
- To: Majestic fire dragon with wing animations,
      flame effects, detailed scales, Legends Arceus quality

Environments:

#### 🌍 **MMO Server Creation & Management**

**Vision:** AI-powered tools for creating and managing private game servers

**The Community Gaming Revolution:**

Many players are frustrated with corporate decisions in modern gaming—from aggressive monetization to controversial features. Kimi K2 empowers the community to create their own gaming experiences.

```
Private Server Creation Examples:

World of Warcraft Private Servers:
- Community-driven alternatives (like Project Midnight)
- No forced real-money transactions
- Player-chosen features and content
- Free from corporate monetization pressures
- Community governance and rules

Why This Matters:
- Players unhappy with in-game housing monetization
- Backlash against real currency requirements
- Desire for classic experiences without modern additions
- Community control over game direction
```

**AI-Assisted Server Setup - ALL WoW Expansions:**

```python
# Kimi K2 assists with TrinityCore-based server setup
# For educational, preservation, and community purposes
